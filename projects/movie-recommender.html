                overview="The Movie Recommender System is an advanced machine learning project that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The system combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches to deliver highly accurate suggestions."
                details="The project demonstrates my expertise in machine learning algorithms, data processing, and web development. I implemented both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering methods, along with a content-based recommendation engine that analyzes movie features such as genre, cast, and plot keywords.">
